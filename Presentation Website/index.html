                <p>I am a fledgling Computer Scientist studying at John Abbott College. Computer Science is a field that best represents the future for me. It's how we manage information, resources and relationships.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The computer science field posses plenty of opportunities and the fields that interest me the most are security and artificial intelligence.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have experience with the C# language as well as html and css (as you may be aware from this site) and am currently learning about javascript</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are plenty of things that I must improve, but I am willing to learn and work hard to develop the skills necessary so I can deliver the best work possible.</p>
